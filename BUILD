# commands to resolve external dependencies. This results in a `.build` file

# populate the `swift_deps.bzl` with `swift_package` declarations for all of
# the direct and transitive Swift packages that your project uses.
#
# The `swift_update_pkgs_to_latest` target should be run when you want to
# update your Swift dependencies to their latest eligible version.
